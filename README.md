# pet-adoption
My first program written for the Ethereum Blockchain

To use, clone the repo.

After downloaded, install ganache and connect it with the metamask chrome extension on your chrome browser. Set your metamask wallet to the connected ganache account (so you don't send real eth).

In terminal run

truffle compile

truffle migrate

npm run dev

This will open the pet adoption site on your browser an allow for action to be recorded on your ganache blockchain. lmk if you think of something that could make this better!
